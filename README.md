**Experiment 3: Arithmetic Operators in C++**

**Title of the Experiment:**
To study and implement the use of arithmetic operators in C++

**Objective / Aim:**
To understand and apply different arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus in a C++ program.

**Tools and Software Used:**

* Code::Blocks IDE or Visual Studio Code
* GCC Compiler (MinGW or g++)
* Operating System: Windows or Linux

**Theory:**
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
Arithmetic operators in C++ are used to perform mathematical calculations. The commonly used arithmetic operators include:

* `+` Addition
* `-` Subtraction
* `*` Multiplication
* `/` Division
* `%` Modulus (remainder)

These operators are usually applied to numeric data types such as `int`, `float`, or `double`.

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program
2. Declare two variables for input
3. Take input from the user
4. Perform the five arithmetic operations: +, -, \*, /, %
5. Display the results
6. End the program

**Flowchart (text description):**
Start → Input two numbers → Perform arithmetic operations → Display results → End

**Conclusion:**
The experiment was successfully performed. All arithmetic operators worked as expected, giving the correct results. This experiment helped reinforce the understanding of operator usage in C++ programming.
